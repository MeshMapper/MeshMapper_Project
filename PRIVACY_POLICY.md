# MeshMapper Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 22, 2026**

## Introduction

MeshMapper (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) is a mesh network coverage mapping application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data

We collect GPS coordinates from your device to map mesh network coverage areas. This location data is:

- Collected only while you are actively using the wardriving features
- Associated with signal quality measurements (SNR, RSSI, noise floor)
- Uploaded to our servers to contribute to community coverage maps

### Device and Network Data

When mapping mesh networks, we collect:

- Your device’s GPS coordinates
- Signal strength and quality metrics from nearby mesh repeaters
- Timestamps of when coverage data was recorded
- Your device’s reported noise floor readings
- Mesh node identifiers (public keys) that your device discovers

### Device Authentication

To verify data submissions and prevent false or malicious data from being uploaded, we may store:

- Your MeshCore Companion device name
- Your device’s public key

This information is used solely for API authentication and data integrity purposes. There is no account creation required.

## How We Use Your Information

We use collected data to:

- Build and display mesh network coverage maps
- Help the MeshCore community understand network reach and performance
- Improve mesh network planning and deployment
- Provide regional administrators with coverage insights

## Data Sharing

- **Community Coverage Maps**: Aggregated coverage data is shared publicly through our mapping platform at meshmapper.net
- **App Developers**: MeshMapper developers may view detailed coverage information to ensure data integrity and identify fraudulent submissions
- **Regional Administrators**: Regional POCs may view detailed coverage data within their assigned regions to ensure data integrity
- **No Sale of Data**: We do not sell your personal information to third parties

## Data Storage and Security

- Coverage data is stored on our servers
- Location data is associated with signal measurements, your MeshCore device name, and your device’s public key
- We implement reasonable security measures to protect stored data

## Device Permissions

### Bluetooth

MeshMapper uses Bluetooth to connect to MeshCore mesh radio devices. Bluetooth is used solely for:

- Communicating with your mesh radio hardware
- Reading mesh network packets for coverage mapping
- Sending discovery requests to map nearby repeaters

### Screen Wake Lock

During active wardriving sessions, the app may keep your screen on to maintain GPS accuracy and continuous data collection. This can be disabled in your device settings.

## Your Choices

- **Location Services**: You can disable location permissions in your device settings, though this will limit the app’s mapping functionality
- **Offline Mode**: You can use passive receive-only mode without uploading data
- **Data Deletion**: Contact us to request deletion of your contributed coverage data

## Children’s Privacy

MeshMapper is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes through the app or our website.
